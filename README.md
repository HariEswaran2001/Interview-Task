# Interview-Task
This is the first round of the interview task is the screening test. The tool that I have used for this round called **FIGMA**.

**Design Requirements and Resources**

**Font Usage:** I have Utilized the ‘Manrope’ font available at Google Fonts.

**Frame Size:** I have designed each section within a frame measuring 1920 x 1080 pixels for websites and for mobile, the pixels were around 393 x 852.

**Iconography:** I have used the extension called the SVG export, from where I got the actual icons used by the website. And I have also used plugin called Iconify to get the icons as a resource for the missing icons in the website.

**Reference Material:** I have used **Minutes by Tandemloop **provided by Tandemloop as a reference material for mobile layouts and I have used the assets provided as a reference for the website.

**Note:** The section 3 for mobile layout is different from the reference provided. So I have used my idea and recreated the design!

I first started to recreate the design for the websites with the given assests. I have used auto layouts in the screens to make the design process easy and for the purpose of proper alignment. The font sizes used for the websites are 40px Bold for Headings/Highlights, 20px Medium for SubHeadings, 18px Regular for the description. The icon size is about 36px, 30px and 24px for various sections. 

After finishing the design for websites, I moved to the mobile design. I used the same cards, frames and reduced its size accordingly for the mobile screens. The last section (i.e section 3) is different. I used carousel for the cards as a mobile view.
